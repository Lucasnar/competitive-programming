# competitive-programming

The purpose of this repository is to store my solutions for programming problems I solved while studying for programming competitions. I am no expert in competitive programming, and I don't have much experience participating in them - I am only an enthusiat. I enjoy learning new algorithms and programming techniques as well as solving these programming problems.

Alert: **There may be programs that are not completed and do not solve the problems they are related to.**

Feel free to contact me at *lucasnar@gmail.com* should you have any questions.
